## URLS
- [https://localhost](https://localhost) - Symfony app
- [https://localhost/api](https://localhost/api) - Swagger/OpenAPI UI

## Running tests
- `make unit-tests` - Run unit tests
- `make setup-tests && make integration-tests` - Run integration tests

## Architecture Decision Log
- The docker setup is based on KÃ©vin Dunglas's [Symfony docker](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker).
- The whole REST API is based on API Platform.
- Products and ProductTypes are fully managed by the API Platform OOTB and are stored in database - you need to create some to be able to generate a PaymentSchedule.
- The CQRS pattern is implemented and integrated with symfony/messenger to handle commands and queries synchronously or asynchronously on separate buses.
- Money should be received, stored and returned as an integer to avoid floating-point precision issues.
- Integration tests setup is using separate test database and has rollback mechanism to keep the database clean.
- If the amount cannot be divided into equal parts, the last instalment will be the remaining amount.

## Logic

### PaymentScheduleStrategies:
- `StandardPaymentScheduleStrategy` - Generates a payment schedule with one payment.
- `JunePaymentScheduleStrategy` - Generates a payment schedule with two payments. 
The first instalment is 30% of the total amount and the second payment is the remaining 70% of the total amount.
- `DecemberYearlyPaymentScheduleStrategy` - Generates a payment schedule with twelve payments. 
- `JanuaryTwoEqualPaymentsScheduleStrategy` - Generates a payment schedule with two payments.

If the amount cannot be divided into equal parts, the last instalment will be the remaining amount.
