# Recruitment Task for TravelPlanet
- The docker setup is based on KÃ©vin Dunglas's [Symfony docker](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker).
- The whole REST API is based on API Platform.
- Products and ProductTypes are fully managed by the API Platform OOTB and are stored in database - you need to create some to be able to generate a PaymentSchedule.
- The CQRS pattern is implemented and integrated with symfony/messenger to handle commands and queries synchronously or asynchronously on separate buses.

- Integration tests setup is using separate test database and has rollback mechanism to keep the database clean.
